  The params map is optional, and can contain any of the following keys:
  - :order-by (a vector of maps, each specifying a :field and an :order key)
  - :limit (the number of results to request)
  - :offset (the index of the first result to return, defaults to 0)
  - :include-total (boolean indicating whether to return the total number of records available)
  For example: `{:limit 100 :offset 0 :order-by [{:field \"value\" :order \"asc\"}] :include-total true}`
